# Knapsack-Problem-Solver
A C++ program that solves the classic 0/1 Knapsack problem using three core algorithms: Dynamic Programming, Branch and Bound, and Greedy. Includes user input handling, optimal profit calculation, and item selection tracking for each approach. Great for understanding algorithm design and performance trade-offs.
